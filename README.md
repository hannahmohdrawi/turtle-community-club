# Turtle Community Club
A website created for a turtle loving local community club named Turtle-y In Love.

## Description
Created as part of Codecademy's Fullstack Engineer Module 8 Making A Website Responsive. The project was to build a webpage for a local club. It could be based on a real-life organization you belong to or it can be made up. In this case, Turtle-y In Love was made up to showcase a local community love who perform charity work to conserve turtles. <br />

The idea of this project is to showcase responsive design tools learned in this module.
